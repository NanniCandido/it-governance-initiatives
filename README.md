### üìå Project Overview
Contributed to IT governance by implementing best practices in asset risk management, service catalogues, and a help desk system. Mapped IT processes to improve organizational structure, alignment, and transparency, while deepening my understanding of user support workflows and change management.

**Situation:**  
In response to federal IT governance mandates, TCE-RS needed to adopt a framework of best practices, governance, and compliance to professionalize and standardize how IT services were managed, requested, and delivered.

**Task:**  
Support the implementation of a structured IT governance program, including process standardization, service request automation, and improved operational transparency.

**Action:**
- Led the design of a centralized IT service request system using Oracle Workflow to replace informal channels (e.g., emails, hallway conversations, phone calls).
- Collaborated on the creation of the first institutional **IT Service Catalog**, detailing available services and their respective SLAs.
- Contributed to the implementation of a Help Desk platform and internal **Knowledge Base** to facilitate issue tracking and resolution.
- Supported the deployment of **IT risk management practices**, focusing on tangible infrastructure and business continuity.
- Helped align all initiatives with compliance and governance standards, building a scalable, process-driven model.

**Result:**  
Informal service requests dropped by over **80%**, while visibility, traceability, and request handling times improved significantly. The structured framework became a reference for other departments, who requested adaptations of the system to support their own service delivery, reinforcing a culture of digitalization, governance, and efficiency across the institution.
